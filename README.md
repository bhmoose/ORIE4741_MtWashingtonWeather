This project aims to use numerical weather predicton model output to improve forecasts for the weather on Mt. Washington, NH. Currently, frequently-used numerical weather prediction systems have resolutions that are generally too low to model the highly-variable (over short distances) weather of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. We think that, by considering station observation data and archived weather model output, we can apply machine learning techniques to model output to get enhanced forecasts for the Mt. Washington summit. That is, perhaps certain signals from numerical weather prediction models (even if the model does not forecast the hyperlocal conditions on the summit well) correlate with higher likelihood of high winds, for example, on the summit. We plan to focus on winds, since it is a distinguishing characteristic of Mt. Washington (which recorded the highest ever measured wind gust outside of a tornado) and a feature with potential hyperlocal, topography-induced nuances (that make it a useful one to predict via the above framework).
